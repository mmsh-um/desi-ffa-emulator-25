# The FFA process is split into two stages:
# 1) Friends-of-friends or close-friend-counts (CFC)
# 2) Emulation

# (1) is implemented in the fof_v1.0 directory while (2) is in emulate_bitw_v1.1. When dealing with a certain catalog, the CFC step has to only be run once unless the linking length is being changed. This step can take 10 to 15 minutes, depending on the size of the catalog. Once this has been run, the outputs are used as inputs for the emulation step. Here, you can change parameters such as beta0, beta1, deco etc and re-run the emulation as many times as you wish. This is step is much quicker. 

# The starting point is going to be a file of the form 'pota-DARK.fits' or 'pota-BRIGHT.fits', depending on the program of interest. The first step is to add NTILE values to this catalog - these are needed for the emulator to work. Use the NTILE_assign.py file for this. An example run for this would be:

python Abacus_V4_2_examples/NTILE_assign.py --indir $PATH_TO_POTENTIALASSIGNMENTS --tracer $TRACER --tileloc_add y --prog $DARK_OR_BRIGHT --skip_spec n

# The next step is to run the CFC finder and the emulator. Their parameters and usage is given within their respective directories but I used a combined file for easy pipelining when running Abacus_Summit_v4_2 for my tests. This script is given in Abacus_V4_2_examples/emulation_example.py
# This can be run using:

python Abacus_V4_2_examples/emulation_example.py --mockver AbacusSummit_v4_2 --real $MOCK_REALIZATION_NUMBER --tracer $TRACER --prep $y_OR_n --emulate $y_OR_n --adj_qref $y_OR_n --emubeta0 $BETA_0 --emubeta1 $BETA_1 --deco $DECO --foflinklen 0.02 --antico y --emulator_dir $EMULATOR_DIRECTORY --galcap B --output_directory_final $FINAL_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY 

# --prep y will run the DESI_wemu.py file to do any pre-processing steps to get data in the right form from the NTILE_assign.py file's outputs. --prep n will skip this step. --emulate y will run the CFC and emulation steps. --adj_qref y will adjust the kernel's shape depending on the emubeta0 and emubeta1 parameters. --adj_qref n will keep the learned kernel. --antico y will turn on the --deco parameter. --output_directory_final should be the location where you want the final output written. --emulator_dir should be the directory that holds the fof_v1.0 and emulate_bitw_v1.1 directories.
